# FloraFlow

## Description:
Omer, a new seller in Hyderabad's Gudimalkapur flower market, struggles to manage his flower
stock due to uncertainty about customer preferences and sales trends. The market is large, with
over 200 sellers and high demand for flowers like marigold, which accounts for 40% of sales. To
improve his business, Omer needs a way to understand which flowers are most popular, when
they are in demand, and how to better manage his inventory, reducing waste and boosting
success.
As Omer's friend and an agricultural data scientist, you can help him optimize his flower shop by
analyzing market data to identify high-demand flowers, key customer segments (such as event
organizers, temple visitors, or daily consumers), and the most profitable flower varieties. This
will enable Omer to stock the right flowers at the right time, target relevant customers, and
forecast seasonal trends to improve sales and reduce inventory waste.
You are given sample data, add features accordingly to your need. Then, clean and preprocess the
data to remove inconsistencies and structure it for analysis. By applying data visualization tools
understand the demand-trend that show which flowers are most popular and which customer
groups are driving sales. Machine learning models will then be used to predict demand patterns,
allowing Omer to shape his inventory accordingly. This approach should give Omer clear
insights, making him position his shop optimally and maximize profits.


## Target Audience:
- Flower Sellers: To optimize inventory and meet demand trends.
- Agricultural Producers: Who can use the insights to breed or grow flowers that meet
market demand, improving yield and profits.
- Retail Customers: For fresh, seasonal flowers for personal use and rituals.
